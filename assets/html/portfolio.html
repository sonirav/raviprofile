Client:A Leading Fashion House<br>
 My Role:The challenge was to study an existing successfully implemented product and find its cost and accounting related outputs and integrate with new accounting software in a seamless manner. This came as a requirement from a leading fashion house. A team of developers and project coordinators was deployed under my supervision at client side.

 Result:My background with ERP and Business accounting helped me to design the Database structure and Chart of Accounts which is the heart of any accounting package.<br>
 • The company rewarded me with Special Achievement Award for 2005-2006.<br>
• Web Based Financial Accounting project was completed in much before target time with a team of seven developers resulting in reduction of development cost.<br>
• In order to make the software more credible in market I played a key role to get the financial accounting system by getting it certified from a major accounting company.<br>
• This product was later marketed as a finished product for global market.<br>
